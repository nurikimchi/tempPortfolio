# My Temporary Portfolio Website

This placeholder site contains relevant information about my experience, skills, and hobbies formatted with TailwindCSS Lab's pre-built [templates](https://tailwindui.com/templates).

## Permanent Portfolio?

I'll transport the same information from this site to a new, longer project where I create my own CSS styles. As this would take longer than using a pre-existing template, I made this a placeholder to get my work out there while I build my original longer project synchronously.
