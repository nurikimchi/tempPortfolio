export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

## The Issue

In React, every time state changes, its parent function component is rerun. This can greatly increase loading times--especially if large memory consuming processes are being rerun (e.g. localStorage).

```js
export default App () {
    // if 'checklistItem' state is changed, the parent functional component: 'App' will rerun--including heavy memory processes such as 'localStorage'
    const [checklistItem, setChecklistItems] = React.useState(
        JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('checklistItem')) || []
    )
}
```

## The Fix

The fix is simple: make state a function. By doing so, we successfully make state run once instead on every state change and initialize state to be lazy--hence lazy state initialization.

```js
export default App() {
    // By making 'checklistItem' state an arrow function, we successfully implement lazy state initialization!
    const [checklistItem, setChecklistItems] = React.useState(
        () => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('checklistItem')) || []
    )
}
```
