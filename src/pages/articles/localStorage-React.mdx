## What is localStorage?

localStorage is a property of JavaScript's window interface
(an object that represents a browser window with DOM elements).
It allows JavaScript websites to save and retrieve key/value pairs
after a browser window is closed. It has several methods including
setItem(), getItem(), and removeItem() that manage key/value pairs
made through localStorage. These pairs can only be strings. Other data types
can be managed by localStorage if converted to strings through JSON methods
(more on that later).

### setItem()

This method creates a new key/value pair that can later be accessed by getItem() and removeItem() after the browser window is closed.

```js
// makes a key: 'myNewKey' with its value 'myNewValue'
localStorage.keyItem('myNewKey', 'myNewValue')
```

### getItem()

This method accesses the value set by setItem() through one parameter, a key value.

```js
// @returns {string} 'myNewValue'
localStorage.getItem('myNewKey')
```

### removeItem()

Like getItem(), removeItem() only needs one parameter, the key value, to remove the key and its value.

```js
// removes 'myNewKey' and its value 'myNewValue'
localStorage.removeItem('myNewKey')
```

## Use Other Data Types in localStorage Through JSON Methods

### JSON.stringify()

Converts any data type into a string. Since localStorage only accepts parameters as strings so you must convert any other data type to a string before passing it as a localStorage parameter.

```js
const myNewObjectValue = {
    id: 1,
    name 'Nuri Kim',
    age: 14
}

// sets the string version of 'myNewObjectValue' to the key string value 'myNewObjectValue' to localStorage
localStorage.setItem('myNewObjectKey', JSON.stringify(myNewObjectValue))
```

### JSON.parse()

Converts a stringified value to its original data type. When string data is saved into localStorage, its value can be retrieved and returned to its original data type through JSON.parse()

```js
// @returns {object} 'myNewObjectValue' from a string into its original type
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('nevObjectKey'))
```

## localStorage and React

### useEffect()

useEffect is a hook that handles events outside of React including API/database calls, subscriptions (e.g. WebSocket), and <b>localStorage</b>. Combined with a dependency array, you can add a key/value pair into localStorage after a certain value within that array has changed. The array is the second parameter in useEffect(). If an array contains a variable, useEffect() will run everytime that variable has changed. If the second parameter/array is empty, useEffect() will run once after its parent component has finished loading.
Example: In our checklist app, we want to implement a feature where a user's added items will not disappear after he/she refreshes or closes the browser window. The following code successfully implements this feature to our App component if added to a working codebase:

```js
export default App() {
    const [checklistItem, setChecklistItems] = React.useState(
        // if there is no 'checklistItem' in localStorage, 'checklistItem' of useState is an empty array
        JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('checklistItem')) || []
    )

    // after a checklistItem is added or changed (see dependency array), set the variable 'checklistItem' as a key with its value being the stringified 'checklistItem'
    React.useEffect(() => {
        localStorage.setItem('checklistItem', JSON.stringify(checklistItem))}), [checklistItem]
}
```
