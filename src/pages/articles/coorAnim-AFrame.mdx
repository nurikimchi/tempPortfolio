## The Problem
If you tried searching for A-Frame animations on the web, you’d probably see articles and documentation exclusively discussing built-in animation properties, gLTF model animations, and a library called [aframe-animation-timeline-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-animation-timeline-component) aiming to outline and execute sequences of grouped and individual animations.

You’re probably unable to find a fleshed-out solution connecting built-in rotation, position, scaling, or visibility animations of an ```<a-entity>``` to a gLTF model’s clip animations. So how do you connect and run them together, simultaneously?

In this article, I’ll be showing how—with some custom JavaScript functions—you can have any gLTF model coordinate its clip animations with its positional, rotational, or size-changing animation attributes provided by A-Frame.

## Positional, rotational, or scaling animations of A-Frame
Let’s establish some common ground, A-Frame has built-in values for its ```animation``` attribute. Examine each code snippet if you’re unsure changing an ```<a-entity>```’s positional or rotational values of its animation attribute.

These just cover position and rotation component values but similar structure applies for scale. Visibility’s ```to``` and ```from``` sister attributes are boolean values.

### Position:
```html
<a-box position="-1 1.6 -5" animation="property: position; to: 1 8 -10; dur: 2000; easing: linear; loop: true" color="tomato"></a-box>
```

### Rotation:
```html
<a-box rotation="0 0 0" animation="property: rotation; to: 0 360 0; loop: true; dur: 10000” color="blue"></a-box>
```

## gLTF model movement
WebVR developers can import gLTF models from third-party websites like [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com) into their visualizations.

For few free and many paid models, gLTF models can have several clip animations. Search your third-party CAD model provider for a list.

Once you initially downloaded your model as a gLTF and [converted](https://products.groupdocs.app/conversion/gltf-to-obj) into an usable .glb file, place it in your project.

Once your server shows a static entity, define its attribute as ```animation-mixer=“clip: {}”```.

```html
<a-entity
    id="..."
    gltf-model="./assets/adultGiraffeTextured.glb"
    position="..."
    rotation="..."
    scale="..."
    animation-mixer="clip: Rest">
</a-entity>
```
Awesome, so we now understand how to implement built-in A-Frame animations and gLTF clip animations separately! Now, to synchronizing them together!

<h2 id="discovered-solution">Discovered solution</h2>
Several animation attributes, denoted by ```animation```, can simultaneously be assigned to a parent entity. Simply append two underscores and a string after: ```animation__{appear}```. 

```html
 <a-entity
  id="..."
  gltf-model="./assets/adultGiraffeTextured.glb"
  position="..."
  rotation="..." 
  scale="..."
  animation__1_0="
      property: position;
      from: ...;
      to: ...;
      dur: ...;
  "
  animation__1a="
      startEvents: animationcomplete__1_0, animationcomplete__6a;
      property: ...;
      from: ...;
      to: ...;
      autoplay: ...;
      dur: ...;
  "
  animation__2a="
      startEvents: animationcomplete__1_0, animationcomplete__6a;
      property: position;
      from: ...;
      to: ...;
      autoplay: ...;
      dur: ...;
  ">
</a-entity>
```
Make ```a-entity```’s usable JavaScript objects, select and declare it as a variable. Ensure all the following JavaScript functions are wrapped in a ```<script>``` tag and placed **after** your A-Frame.
```js
var giraffeA1 = document.querySelector('#giraffe-A1')
```

Combine this with A-Frame’s built-in ```animationbegin``` event and JavaScript functions can detect when one or several animations begin. We will be leveraging this default, emitted ```animationbegin``` event as our switch cases.

```js
giraffeA1.addEventListener('animationbegin', animationCorresponder)
```

Console log ```event.detail.name``` in a separate event listener with the same first (```type```) argument. Open the console and see that each animation name is logs with its respective start.
```js
giraffeA1.addEventListener('animationbegin', function (e) {
    console.log(e.detail.name);
})
```

<details>
  <summary>Why does ```animCorr``` not explicitly pass the ```event``` argument?</summary>
   > ```animCorr``` is automatically passed and supplemented with the ```event``` object by JavaScript’s built-in event system.
</details>

The ```addEventListener``` detects ```animation__1``` emitted the string “animationbegin” and subsequently calls the ```animCorr``` function. The ```animCorr``` function traces the emitted string back to its original signaler—```animation__1```—and sets the entity’s ```’animation-mixer’, {‘clip’: ‘Drink’}```. 

Thus, you’ll see the model almost simultaneously move and perform its clip animation. 

## Concluding suggestions
Instead of working with strings of HTML elements, feel free to programmatically declare A-Frame entities via ```AFRAME.registerComponent```; they offer more flexibility and better scalability.
